# Exam Arena — Frontend Architecture & Standards Audit

> **Status:** baseline captured 2026-10-18 · remediation tracked in the checklist below.
> **Branch at audit time:** `feat/dashboard-mascot` @ `b6e8fb7`.
> **Remediation branch:** `feature/frontend-standards-improvements`.

## 0. Scope and method

**Stack:** Next.js 14.2 App Router, `output: "export"`, React 18.3, Tailwind 3.4, zustand 5,
TanStack Query 5, Dexie 4, Firebase 12, Capacitor 8, Serwist PWA, Vitest 2, Playwright 1.63.

**Surface audited:** 142 `.tsx` · 166 `.ts` · 8 `.css` · 28 test files · 38 route pages.

**Out of scope for this remediation pass:** `src/components/onboarding/story-intro.tsx`,
`src/components/onboarding/story-intro.module.css`, and any Story Intro refactoring
(extraction of its components/hooks/parsing rules/math, line-count reduction, design or
behaviour changes). Story Intro is tracked separately. The only permitted edit was a
3-line identifier rename that unblocked the production build (committed as
`fix(onboarding): rename shadowed map param in story intro group card`) — a bug fix, not a
refactor.

**Not verified:** no screen was visually inspected during the audit, so no claim is made
about visual correctness in either theme or at any breakpoint.

## A. Executive Summary

A coherent, well-instrumented codebase with a genuine design-token layer, wrapped around a
handful of extremely large "god files" that break the component model.

Component-based architecture is **partially** followed. There is a real `src/components/ui`
primitive set (13 files), a real hooks layer, a real store layer, and a real token layer —
but the bulk of product logic lives in six files over 500 lines that each define 10–35
sub-components, embed business math, hardcode data arrays, and duplicate theming logic 163
times in JavaScript instead of CSS.

### Five most important findings

1. **Root-layout eager onboarding import** — `src/components/shell/app-entry.tsx:8`
   statically imports `@/app/onboarding/page`, pulled into `src/app/layout.tsx:8`. The
   entire onboarding flow ships in the initial chunk of every route.
2. **`dark:` variants track the OS, not the app theme** — `tailwind.config.ts` had no
   `darkMode` key, so all 26 `dark:` utilities keyed off `prefers-color-scheme` while the
   app themes via a `.light` class toggled by `src/stores/theme-store.ts`.
3. **Toasts rendered outside the theme scope** — `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx:63`
   portalled to `document.body`, outside every `[data-theme-scope]`.
4. **`story-intro.tsx` is a 2,856-line god file** — 35 component/helper definitions, inline
   speech-parsing regex rules, inline commitment math, an inline `useTween` hook, and an
   836-line CSS Module. *(Deferred — excluded from this pass.)*
5. **No CI, no typecheck script, 23.21% coverage** — `tsc --noEmit` was not wired into any
   script; a type error that blocked `next build` was only caught by running the build.

## B. Architecture Scorecard (baseline, 0–5)

| Category | Baseline | Target after this pass | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Component architecture | 2 | 2 | 6 files >500 lines; `story-intro.tsx` 2,856L / 35 defs. |
| Folder structure | 4 | 4 | Clean top-level split, 100% `@/` aliases, no cycles; mixed PascalCase/kebab-case dirs. |
| Reusability & separation of concerns | 2 | 3 | 5× `formatTime`, 3× `SectionLabel`, ~25 hand-rolled skeletons; `services/adaptive.ts` imports a store. |
| CSS & design-system consistency | 3 | 3.5 | ~944 tokens, 6 clean CSS Modules, zero raw hex in Tailwind config; 163 JS theme ternaries. |
| Light/Dark Mode | 2 | 3.5 | Sound class-scoped mechanism + tests; undermined by media-based `dark:`, out-of-scope Toaster, raw `VIOLET` in light branches. |
| Responsive design | 3 | 3 | `--sat/--sab` tokens, ~470 `max-[359px]` tweaks, dedicated responsive spec; fixed widths clipped by global `overflow-x: hidden`. |
| TypeScript & React practices | 3.5 | 4 | `"strict": true`, tsc clean; 1 `any`, `as any`, 4 lint warnings. |
| Accessibility | 2 | 3 | Axe infra + passing spec on 3 routes; no coverage of authenticated screens, app-wide scrollbar hiding. |
| Performance | 2 | 3 | Static export + Serwist + React Query; eager onboarding in root layout, always-bundled mocks, eager gsap in shell. |
| Testing & developer tooling | 3 | 4 | 337 tests pass, coverage/axe/responsive configured; no CI, no `typecheck` script. |

## C. Findings

Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational.

| # | Sev | Category | Location | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical | Light/Dark | `tailwind.config.ts` | No `darkMode` key → 26 `dark:` utilities follow OS, not app theme. | ☐ |

| 10 | High | Error handling | `play/configure-sprint/page.tsx:44` | `.then()` with no `.catch()` → permanent spinner on rejection. | ☐ |
| 11 | High | a11y | `tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts:4` | Axe scans only `/`, `/auth`, `/onboarding` — none of the 38 authenticated screens. | ☐ |
| 12 | Medium | React | `learn/practice/page.tsx:190-194` | Missing effect deps (lint warning). | ☐ |
| 13 | Medium | React | `learn/explorer/page.tsx:78`, `explorer/mind-map.tsx:59`, `onboarding/feature-intro.tsx:321` | Remaining `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings. | ☐ |
| 14 | Medium | Performance | `shell/app-shell.tsx:6` | Eager `Walkthrough`, `RatePrompt`, `Toaster`, `gsap` in the authenticated shell. | ☐ |
| 15 | Medium | Performance | `lib/notifications/story-reminders.ts:1-2`, `invite-card.tsx:8-9`, `habit-tracker-modal.tsx:35-36` | Static `@capacitor/*` imports reached from eagerly-loaded routes. | ☐ |
| 16 | Medium | Data layer | `practice/page.tsx`, `configure-sprint/page.tsx`, `sprint/results/page.tsx`, `ui/content-feedback.tsx` | Direct service calls bypassing React Query. | ☐ |

| 19 | Medium | Responsive | `renderers/*` `w-[500px]`/`w-[560px]` + `globals.css:1218-1221` | Fixed widths clipped by global `overflow-x: hidden`. | ☐ |
| 20 | Medium | a11y | `globals.css:1196-1202` | Scrollbars hidden app-wide. | ☐ |
| 21 | Medium | State | `onboarding-modal.tsx:176-185, 269-289` | 8-way local/store mirror with bidirectional `toggleTrigger` sync. | ☐ |
| 22 | Low | Theming | `learn/page.tsx:894`, `play/page.tsx:85` | Half-flipped alpha tints (text uses `hueText`, background uses raw hex). | ☐ |
| 23 | Low | Assets | `styles/driver-override.css:3` | Literal font names under `next/font`; all-dark popover. | ☐ |
| 24 | Low | Lifecycle | `paywall-modal.tsx:161`; `adaptive-reprompt.tsx:88-99`; `onboarding-modal.tsx:244-254` | `setTimeout`/GSAP tweens without cleanup. | ☐ |

## F. Remediation checklist

Updated as work progresses. `[x]` = implemented and re-verified on this branch;
`[~]` = partial / deferred; `[ ]` = not done.

### Critical

- [ ] **#1 `darkMode: "class"`** — make `dark:` follow the in-app theme store.
- [ ] **#2 Toaster theme scope** — portal inherits `[data-theme-scope]` tokens.
- [ ] **#3 Lazy onboarding** — `next/dynamic` in `app-entry.tsx`, remove static page import.
- [ ] **#4 `typecheck` script + GitHub Actions CI** (typecheck, lint, unit tests).

### High

- [ ] **#5 Mock tree-shaking** — stop shipping `lib/mock/**` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCK=false`.
- [ ] **#6 Dashboard fallback data** — real loading/empty/error states instead of fabricated data.
- [ ] **#7 `src/lib/format.ts`** — single source for `formatTime`, `formatDuration`, `formatDate`/`timeAgo`, `formatMembers`, `clamp`, `todayStr`; delete duplicates.
- [ ] **#8/#9 Habit tracker** — copy before sort; replace raw `VIOLET` with tokens.
- [ ] **#10 Sprint config error handling** — `.catch` + error UI.
- [ ] **#11 A11y coverage** — add authenticated routes to the axe spec.
- [ ] **#12/#13 Effect-dependency lint warnings** — clear all 4.

### Medium

- [ ] **#14 Lazy shell UI** — `Walkthrough` / `RatePrompt` via `next/dynamic`.
- [ ] **#15 Lazy native plugins** — dynamic import inside `isNativePlatform()` branches.
- [ ] **#16 Query-layer routing** for direct service calls.
- [ ] **#17–#20 CSS hardening** — font re-scale, attribute-scraping selectors, scrollbar scoping, fixed-width renderers.
- [ ] **#21 Onboarding modal state mirror**.

### Low / Info

- [ ] **#22 Half-flipped alpha tints.**
- [ ] **#23 Driver tour font + light styling.**
- [ ] **#24 Lifecycle cleanups.**
- [ ] **#25 Remove unused deps** (`animejs`, `zod`, `@capacitor/preferences`) — only after verifying zero references.
- [ ] **#26 Type hygiene.**
- [ ] **#27 `services/adaptive.ts` layering.**
- [ ] **#28/#29 Naming + README branch name.**

### Explicitly out of scope for this pass

- [ ] **#31 Story Intro god-file refactor** — deferred to a dedicated task.
- [ ] Onboarding modal / adaptive-dashboard god-file splits — large refactors, separate task.
